# CollisionDetectionNITTHACKATHON
this is my project of nitt hackathon , which checks collsion detection of airport vehicles . 


The main part if the app ,which is available as apk in the github . The app runs on flask server which runs on my computer
So if we configure flask and ngrok and put the ngrok weblink in android , all three will be linked and the project will run
